This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) when handling null or undefined values.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, resulting in incorrect logic and potential errors.  Strict equality ensures a precise comparison, preventing such issues.
